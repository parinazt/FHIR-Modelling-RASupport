# FHIR-Modelling-RASupport

This Implementation Guide (IG) provides a standardized framework for the collection, exchange, and utilization of patient-reported symptoms and clinical data in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remission and low disease activity. It enables the development of conversational systems and clinical decision support tools that promote continuous monitoring, timely intervention, and personalized patient education.

This guide leverages FHIR resources to structure symptom input, disease activity assessments, and feedback mechanisms, ensuring interoperability across EHRs, telehealth platforms, and patient engagement tools. Designed for clinicians, developers, and researchers, this IG supports enhanced patient outcomes through smarter, symptom-driven RA management.
